# Form Component for a recruitment task

This is a basic form component for adding recipes to a website.

It was designed and created by ≈Åukasz Wojtalewicz.

The entire task took about two days, mainly due to Final-Form being new library, that I had to learn.

## Node Version

16.13.1

## NPM Version

8.1.4

## Setting up

Simply run npm install and then npm run start in the project root directory.

!! Important
Some of the app's functionality relies on a package called 'react-final-form-listeners' created by the author of 'react-final-form'. It was not updated for react v18.1.0, so in order to install it, it has to be forced by typing npm install react-final-form-listeners --force.

## Tools Used

- React

- Axios

- Sass

- Final-Form

- react-toastify

- format-string-by-pattern
